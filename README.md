# node-unshortener 0.0.3

A simple library that can unshorten any short url.

## Install

     npm install unshortener

or

     git clone https://github.com/Swizec/node-unshortener.git
     cd node-unshortener
     npm link

Then make sure settings are set up

     cd node-unshortener
     cp settings.js local_settings.js

You should now edit local_settings.js to enter your bitly credentials.

## Usage

     // expand an URL
     var unshortener = require('unshortener');

     // you can pass in a url object or string
     unshortener.expand('http://t.co/rWP6BP3',
                        function (url) {
                             // url is a url object
                             console.log(url);
                        });


## How it works

node-unshortener aims to be able to unshorten any link possible, so it
tries to behave as a browser and simply follows all the
redirects. However, to be nice, when at all possible, it tries to use
the url shortener's official API.

That said, please feel free to suggest any unshortening services I may
have missed.

Services directly supported so far:
   - bit.ly
   - j.mp
   - is.gd
